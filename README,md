# YouTube: Hide Watched Videos (Userscript)

This userscript is designed for use with the **ViolentMonkey** extension on the **Brave** browser. It automatically hides both regular and Shorts videos on YouTube that have been watched more than **60%**, helping to keep your subscriptions and homepage cleaner and more relevant.

## Features

- Hides both watched videos and Shorts
- Only hides videos watched more than 60% (can be adjusted directly in the script)
- Remembers your selection across sessions (toggle persists until manually changed)
- Clean and minimal interface near the microphone/search bar on YouTube

## How to Use

1. Install the [ViolentMonkey extension](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) on your Brave browser.
2. Add this script via the ViolentMonkey dashboard.
3. Visit YouTube and click the **"Watched"** button to hide watched videos.
4. Toggle the button again to unhide.

## Compatibility

- ✅ Brave browser
- ✅ YouTube (current as of script creation)
- ⚠️ May break if YouTube changes its layout or class names
